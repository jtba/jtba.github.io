---
Performing daily stand-ups without discussing what was completed the day prior ignore critical information needed to evaluate how you and your team is performing on a daily basis. The Scrumster application complements your daily stand-up by allowing individuals to thoughtfully determine what their tasks are for the day, and easily keep track of tasks missed.

<h4>Features</h4>
* Helps to improve your ability to estimate time taken on tasks and your ability to accomplish them
* Encourages breaking down user stories into manageable chunks
* Distinguishes between planned tasks vs unplanned, further enabling managers to determine if outward forces are impacting employees
* As a manager, improves your one on one's by giving your employees solid stats on their performance
* As a manager, improves your reporting to upper management by your ability to individually list each employee's accomplishments
* Promotes high performing teams
