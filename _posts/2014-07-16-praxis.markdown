description: <h3>Pioneering the shift from scheduled deployments to continuous delivery</h3>

---
Led an early DevOps transformation initiative, bridging the traditional divide between development and operations teams. Established self-service infrastructure provisioning that empowered teams to move from scheduled, manual deployments to on-demand, automated delivery.

<h4>Transformation Outcomes</h4>
* Enabled infrastructure-as-code practices across the organization
* Reduced environment provisioning from days to minutes through automated orchestration
* Unified compute, load balancing, and application configuration into single workflow
* Established foundation for continuous delivery pipeline evolution
