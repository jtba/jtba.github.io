description: <h3>All operational tasks in a single application</h3> 
---
Disenchanted by the dozens of applications we used to perform our daily duties, I architected and developed a web application using **Angular** and **PHP** to bring everything my team needed under a single UI. I guess you could say that I'm lazy, but in a productive way.

<br/><br/>
<h4>Features</h4>

* The ability to reset passwords across multiple application platforms (Tomcat, WebMethods, WebLogic, Oracle) spanning hundreds of servers in less than a minute
* Automatically collect application configuration for quick comparison across your entire cluster
* Central CMDB that allows the team to stay in control of their environment
* Create F5 I-Rules
* Track releases as they are occurring
* Suspend/Activate traffic to specific application instances
