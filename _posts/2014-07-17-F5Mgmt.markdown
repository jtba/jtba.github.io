Faced with a vendor UI that did not meet the needs of daily user interaction with large groups of instances, I created the F5 Cluster Manager.

<h4>Benefits</h4>
* Avoid the need to drill down into individual groups to easily see the cluster status of the individual group members
* Quickly enable/disable group members by dragging your mouse over the members you want to disable/enable
* Manage group members across multiple F5 devices
